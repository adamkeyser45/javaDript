## Description

Javadript is a subscription service application, allowing coders to fulfil their coffee needs on a monthly basis. Offering three packages, consumers will be able to choose the best suited, and then checkout with Stripe. Stripe requires shipping information, as well as credit card, making it possible to have caffeine show up at your door. 

We created this application with the help of React and GraphQl, making sure to follow the most current practices with PWA. Users can create an account, login, and then order their subscription.
